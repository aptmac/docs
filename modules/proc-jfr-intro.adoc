JDK Flight Recorder manages data gathered from the JVM. Data is written in memory, first to thread local buffers, and then promoted to a fixed-size global ring buffer. Traditionally, this data is eventually flushed to JFR files (`*.jfr`) on disk, which is then consumed by other applications for analysis, for example by JDK Mission Control.

.Recordings

Users manage the systemâ€™s recordings. Individual recordings have unique configuration and can be started, stopped, and dumped to disk on demand.

.Events

Events are the basic unit of JFR data. The JVM has pre-existing events and there is API for users to supply both static and dynamic custom events. Every event can be enabled or disabled when recording to minimize overhead.

JFR profiles, or event templates, (`*.jfc`) can be used to configure the events for a recording. The JDK distribution comes with two profiles: 'default' and 'profile'.

default: Low overhead configuration safe for continuous use in production environments, typically less than 1 % overhead.

profile: Low overhead configuration for profiling, typically around 2 % overhead.
