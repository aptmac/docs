= Using Flight Recorder with the JMC Triggers Page

Flight recordings can also be started or dumped in response to a user-defined trigger rule. This can be setup in the Triggers page of a running JVM through the JMX Console.

The left side of the Triggers page displays rules and conditions that, when met, will trigger an action. These actions are listed on the right-side of the Triggers page, under the header *Rule Details*. The JFR-related actions are: Dump Flight Recording, Start Continuous Flight Recording, and Start Time Limited Flight Recording.

For example: a trigger rule could be setup to dump a flight recording containing the last 30 seconds of data in response to the JVM CPU usage surpassing 75%.
