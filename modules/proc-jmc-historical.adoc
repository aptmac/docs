= Historical Analysis (JFR & hprof)

JMC has a separate suite of pages and tools for displaying flight recording information. Flight recording files can be opened via the File menu, or automatically when a flight recording is dumped using JMC. These pages and their functionality will be covered in more detail later, in part 4: Analyzing Flight Recordings using JDK Mission Control.

As of JMC 7.1.0, the JOverflow plugin has been refactored and included by default with JMC. This allows for the visualization of heap dump hprof files (`*.hprof`). For a detailed look at how to use the JOverflow page, see a blog post written by the Marcus Hirt (JMC Project Lead): http://hirt.se/blog/?p=854
